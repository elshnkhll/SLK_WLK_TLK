ESP32 based Walkie-Talkie using Slack.

I am trying to create an Wi-Fi Walkie-Talkie. Here are my goals in terms of features so far:

1. Use ESP32 as a main processing power
2. Use I2C microphone and speaker.
3. Function as a hand held, multi-channel, half-duplex audio communication device
4. Use Slack as a main cloud platform and keep all audio messages on it.
5. Ability select (from 8 to 20 different) channels which are actually Slack channels.
6. Volume control
7. LED indicators: recording, playing, low battery, charging, fully charged.
